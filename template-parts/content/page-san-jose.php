              <h3>WHAT DOES A CRIMINAL LAWYER DO?</h3>
              <p>It’s important to understand what our San Jose CA attorneys will actually do for you or your loved one throughout the entirety of your legal proceedings. The Summit Defense law offices have supported countless unique cases, so we know the differences and similarities throughout all criminal law scenarios.</p>
              <p>Although everyone’s criminal charges are unique, it’s still safe to say that a criminal lawyer will do the following for you no matter what charges you’re currently facing:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>Case Evaluation:</strong> when you reach out to us for a free consultation, our San Jose criminal defense lawyers will get as many details about your unique legal situation as possible. We’ll ask very specific questions so we can learn what your case’s strengths and weaknesses are, and this crucial information will dictate your best course for legal action.</li>
                <li><strong>Case Investigation:</strong> After we’ve conducted our thorough case evaluation, our team will then conduct a comprehensive investigation into your case. This investigation will be aimed at discovering specific avenues of acquittal. We will often interrogate police officers, eyewitnesses, expert witnesses, and anyone else that has important information about your case. This investigation process will go a long way towards developing a strong defense. We’ll also review the prosecution’s case to find holes in their case and further our evidence-gathering strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence Analysis:</strong> This is where your defense attorney and their law offices will carefully study all of the facts and theories that apply to your case.</li>
                <li><strong>Continued Client Contact:</strong> It’s important to note that you’ll be kept in the loop throughout every step of these processes, so you’ll know when certain developments arise and how your course for legal action expands. Communication is key to all of us at Summit Defense because we know just how important these services are for you and your future.</li>
                <li><strong>Jury Selection:</strong> Your San Jose criminal defense lawyer will be integral during jury selection because removing specifically biased jurors will provide defendants with a better likelihood of acquittal.</li>
                <li><strong>Plea Bargaining:</strong> Negotiating with prosecutors within plea bargain scenarios is one of the most important duties of a criminal defense attorney, because securing a favorable deal is nearly impossible when representing yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>Trial Participation: </strong>Our legal team will fight for you during a trial with all of our experience and knowledge at your disposal. This will include examining witnesses, cross-examining the prosecution’s witnesses, and ultimately convincing the jury of your innocence or the prosecution’s failure to meet a sufficient burden of proof.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentencing:</strong> If a client of ours is in fact sentenced to a crime or accepts a plea bargain, then it’ll be our job to represent you during the sentencing negotiations. We’ll help limit the amount of incarceration time or help you obtain alternatives to incarceration.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>HOW MUCH DOES A SAN JOSE CRIMINAL ATTORNEY COST?</h3>
              <p>The overall costs of hiring a criminal defense attorney will largely depend upon the complexity of your unique case, your attorney’s overall experience, and where you’re located.</p>
              <p>The three main payment options for a criminal law specialist are:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Hourly billing</li>
                <li>Case billing</li>
                <li>Retainer fees</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Each of these payment plans will have its pros and cons, and you can learn more about paying a defense attorney <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/paying-private-criminal-defense-attorney.html" >here</a>.</p>
              <h3>WHAT IF I CAN’T AFFORD TO HIRE A SAN JOSE DEFENSE ATTORNEY?</h3>
              <p>A Santa Clara County Public Defender is an affordable option for you if you feel as though you can’t afford a private defense attorney. San Jose CA just so happens to have great public defenders, however, this option is typically only available to indigent individuals.</p>

              <h3>CALIFORNIA CRIMINAL COURT PROCESS</h3>
              <p>The court process within California is like many other states, but it will have its own unique qualities. When you’re arrested and booked, you’ll likely have the opportunity to obtain bail and be released from jail. When you hire Summit Defense as your private defense attorney, you may be able to skip some later court appearances as we’ll represent you.</p>
              <p><strong>Arraignment Hearing:</strong></p>
              <p>You’ll then go through an <a href="https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/criminal-defense-case/criminal-arraignment-what-expect" target="_blank">arraignment hearing</a>, and this is where your defense lawyer and prosecutors will try to reach a resolution without needing to go to trial. The San Jose District Attorney may decide to dismiss your case or reduce charges through a plea agreement during your arraignment, depending upon the strength of their case.</p>
              <p><strong>Preliminary Hearing:</strong></p>
              <p>Those charged with felonies will be entitled to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/preliminary-hearing" target="_blank">preliminary hearing</a>, and the purpose of this hearing is to give the prosecutors an opportunity to present their case to the California court and show that they in fact have a substantial amount of evidence to press charges against you. The burden of proof is low in preliminary hearings because they only have to prove the probable cause of the defendant’s guilt, so it is common for prosecutors to win these cases. However, if our defense lawyers win your preliminary case, then your charges are dismissed.</p>
              <p>If you do end up getting convicted of a crime, you’ll then have a sentence imposed upon you by a judge. There are many instances in which a judge will grant probation instead of jail time, and our legal specialists will ensure that your sentence is as favorable as possible if this situation arises.</p>
