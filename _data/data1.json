Their experience with criminal law and the court systems in the Bay Area showed in the work they did. And when I say work I mean they put in relentless WORK for me. They fought diligently for me and guided me in making choices that were in my best interest. My main goal was to get the best possible outcome in the situation I had gotten into and so was theirs.I don’t know where I’d be or how bad things could have turned out had I not hired Summit Defense. I am very grateful for Rabin and his team.",

Read on to learn more about what we found. </p><h2><strong>A Short History of Private Prisons in the U.S. </strong></h2><p>Before we get started, we wanted to provide a short history of private prisons. The first private prison company, Corrections Corporation of America, was <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/history-of-americas-private-prison-industry-timeline/\">established in 1983</a> under the pretense of running a prison for profit. In 1984, the company started its journey by operating an existing county prison in Tennessee and, later that same year, opened its first facility in Houston, TX. Today, the private prison industry has grown substantially to include a total of 51 private prisons in operation in 16 different U.S. states. Additionally, the prisoner population in those private prisons has grown by <a href=\"https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/private-prisons-united-states/\">47% from 2000 to 2016</a> alone.</p><h2><strong>A Look at the Number of Prisoners Held in Private Prisons in Every State</strong></h2><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3f110af16dd63237a9f0_PrivatePrisons_1-min.png\" alt=\"The Number of Prisoners Held in Private Prisons in Every State\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>We reviewed data from the <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p17.pdf\">Bureau of Justice’s 2017 National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) Program</a> to determine the percentage of each state’s private prison population. Overall, we found that 8.2% of the total U.S. prison population is held in private prisons and 26 states have at least some percentage of its prison population in a private prison.</p><p>Montana has the highest percentage of prisoners in a private prison with 38.1%, followed by Hawaii with 28.5% and Tennessee with 26.3%. On the opposite end of the spectrum, North and South Carolina have the lowest percentage of private prisoners with 0.1%. </p><h2><strong>The Number of Prisoners Held in Private Prisons Relative to Each State’s Population</strong></h2><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3f11a1e800cdbd7e3c0d_PrivatePrisons_2-min.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p> </p><p>To provide an additional comparison into the volume of private prisoners in each state, we calculated the number of prisoners held in private prisons relative to its population. While Montana has the highest percentage of prisoners held in private prisons overall, Oklahoma has the highest number of prisoners held in private prisons per 10,000 residents. Montana has the second-highest number of private prisons per 100,000 residents with 134.13, followed by Arizona with 118.05. </p><p>South Carolina and North Carolina also have the lowest number of private prisoners per 100,000 residents of states with some volume of prisoners in a private facility with 0.48 and 0.29, respectively.</p><figure><div><iframe src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/627306/embed\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div></figure><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3f1012694086b56cc52c_made_with_flourish.svg\" alt=\"Made with Flourish\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Lastly, we looked at the number of private and state prisons in each state, along with the estimated capacity of each. The interactive table above allows you to sort through the data we found. The various views will give you a look into how states compare based on the four variables. </p><p>Both Florida and Texas have the highest number of private prisons with a total of 7 each, compared to their 33 and 55 respective state prisons. Florida also has the highest estimated prisoner capacity in its private prisons with 9,945, followed by Arizona with 8,288. </p><p>The Justice Department announced their plans to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/08/18/justice-department-says-it-will-end-use-of-private-prisons/\">end the use of private prisons in 2016</a>, a decision that was reversed a year later. As shown above, while there are far less private prisons than state prisons, there’s still a number of private prisons in operation across the country. We’ll be following along to see what the future holds for private prisons.

To find out, we collected 2018 data from the <a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/reports/sar-stats\">U.S. Treasury</a> to determine the number of white-collar crimes that occurred in the 100 largest cities around the U.S., relative to the city’s population. The following industries in which white-collar crime can occur were included in our analysis: depository institutions, insurance companies, loan or finance companies, money services businesses, securities and futures, and industries classified as others by the U.S. Treasury. </p><p>We used this data to determine which cities experience the most white-collar crime overall, and also which cities see the most of various common types of white-collar crime including identity theft, forgery, and embezzlement. Read on to learn more about what we uncovered. </p><p><strong>An Overall Look: The Cities with the Most White-Collar Crime</strong></p><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3ea4f6b636137ed1dbef_WCCrimes_1.png\" alt=\"US map showing the cities with the most white-collar crime\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>First, we determined the cities with the most white-collar crimes per 10,000 people in 2018. All categories of white-collar crime referenced above were included in these calculations. Richmond, VA, took the top spot on the list with a total of 7,504.23 white-collar crimes per 10,000 people. Its total was a high margin above the next city on the list, Miami, FL, with 4,237.27 white-collar crimes per 10,000 people. </p><p>Cities in California made up one fifth of the list with 5 cities in the top 25 – Riverside, San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, and Los Angeles. Both Florida and Ohio had 3 cities on the top 25 list. Interestingly, 16 cities’ rate of white-collar crime was above 1,000 crimes per 10,000 people. </p><p><strong>Identity Theft in Cities Around the U.S.</strong></p><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3ea4f3ad8d149b9a6b7e_WCCrimes_2.png\" alt=\"US map showing the cities with the most identity theft crimes\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Next, we focused in on a specific type of white-collar crime that’s one of the more recognizable due to the number of people that it impacts annually. The FTC estimates that as many as <a href=\"https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/silent-crimes/identity-theft/\">9 million Americans</a> have their identities stolen each year, so many can commiserate with the unfortunate after effects that come along with having your identity stolen. </p><p>So, where in the U.S. should you be most concerned about identity theft? According to our analysis, Columbus, OH saw the highest number of identity theft crimes per 10,000 people with 367.89 in 2018. Columbus’ total was more than double the next city on the list, San Francisco with 138.67. Rounding out the top 5 were Charlotte, NC; San Jose, CA; and Miami, FL.</p><p><strong>Forgery Crimes in Cities Around the U.S.</strong></p><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3ea5ae119f589d9e17ca_WCCrimes_3.png\" alt=\"US map showing the cities with the most forgery crimes\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Forgery is another common and also widely recognized type of white-collar crime in the U.S. Though forgery does not occur nearly as frequently as identity theft according to our data, it does impact many people annually. Similar to identity theft, Columbus, OH, also had the highest rate of forgery crimes per 10,000 people with 43.86. Miami, FL, has the second-highest rate with 32.19, followed by San Francisco, CA (26.58); Charlotte, NC (24.29); and Atlanta, GA (20.04). </p><p><strong>Embezzlement Crimes in Cities Around the U.S.</strong></p><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3ea4316a2c1da5398716_WCCrimes_4.png\" alt=\"U.S. map showing the cities with the most embezzlement crimes\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Finally, we finished out our analysis by looking at the rate of embezzlement crimes per 10,000 people in each city. The Penal Code defines embezzlement as <a href=\"https://www.summitdefense.com/business-crimes/embezzlement/\">unlawfully taking the property of someone else by the person to whom it has been entrusted</a>. Las Vegas, NV, and Boston, MA, saw the highest rates of embezzlement crimes per 10,000 people, both with nearly 20 or more. </p><p>Though white-collar crimes are non-violent in nature, they are still serious crimes.

Escorting is legal in some places and illegal in others. But, it’s hard to know where you stand in a legal sense when offering these services. It can be even more difficult if your business spans many jurisdictions.</p><p>On the other hand, prostitution is always illegal. You should know that there’s no way around that fact. If a client pays for sex, then they have already committed a crime. Moreover, they most likely violated human trafficking laws.</p><p>Other than receiving criminal charges, you can also receive civil penalties if you are found guilty of engaging in prostitution. Every state has its own established regulations for these services. Knowing the difference can help you identify if you committed a sex crime or not. Read on to learn more!</p><h2><strong>What Is An Escort?</strong></h2><p> </p><p>It’s also important to know that escorting isn’t synonymous with prostitution. That’s one of the biggest misconceptions about this business. Prostitution is defined as exchanging sexual favors for money, drugs, or other valuable items. The difference revolves around who runs the show during the encounter.</p><p>Escorts are generally independent contractors who offer their time for money. There’s no business relationship between them and their clients. In this sense, escort services are non-sexual services.</p><p>In case you are an escort providing an innocent date, then you are not engaging in sex works. Your client may request some form of physical contact on your part, but you can set the line with the services you offer.</p><p>If there is penetration, then it’s considered sexual intercourse. The law will most likely deem it prostitution.</p><h2><strong>Is Escorting Legal In California?</strong></h2><p>The laws in California allow escorts to offer their company for a fee. But, they must be licensed escorts before they can offer their services. This is the only way they can operate without risking legal trouble.</p><p>It’s essential to know other regulations about escort services to prevent future legal disputes. It’s possible to commit an illegal act even when there’s no sexual activity involved. For example, leading someone to a sexual encounter counts as engaging in illicit activities.</p><h2><strong>Is Having Sex With An Escort Legal In California?</strong></h2><p>The laws in California are stringent about sex work. The state considers escorts separate from prostitutes. This means that it is illegal for an escort to provide any sexual act or sexual penetration in exchange for money.</p><p>There are no legal loopholes when you engage in this type of work. Moreover, the law prohibits anyone from paying to view another person involved in sexually explicit acts.</p><p>On the other hand, the law is not strict with an adult watching appropriate pornography. Other illegal sexual acts involving masturbation may be deemed prostitution under Californian law.</p><h2><strong>What Is A Prostitute?</strong></h2><p> </p><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3c2f560bbc5ed8778494_what-is-a-prostitute-california.png\" alt=\"what-is-a-prostitute-california\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Prostitution is commonly defined as the act or practice of offering sexual services in exchange for money. Punishments for prostitution are often referred to as solicitation. Solicitation varies by state.</p><p>Generally, the punishment for this sexual conduct includes jail time, fines, and community services. A sex offender is required to undergo STI testing and register as a sex offender. Changes to laws about prostitution most often focus on issues surrounding minors.</p><h2><strong>Is Prostitution Legal In California?</strong></h2><p>Like most states, prostitution is illegal in California. The state’s law does not allow people to offer services for sexual gratification. California serves harsh punishments for criminals who are receiving money from sexual actions.</p><p>California’s Penal Code section <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=647.&amp;lawCode=PEN\" target=\"_blank\">647(b)</a> prohibits soliciting another to engage in sexual conduct for hire. A person incriminated for a prostitution offense is subject to up to six months of imprisonment. In addition, they may also face a $1,000 fine.</p><h2><strong>Solicitation</strong></h2><p>Solicitation happens in the same way as prostitution. Both sex acts share the same severe penalties. Solicitation is the act of offering to do a lewd act in exchange for pay and intending to do so.</p><p>The law defines a lewd act as explicitly touching another person’s genitals, buttocks, or breast. A lewd act is also applicable in terms of sexual intercourse. The person they are soliciting does not need to be a prostitute for the crime to happen.</p><h2><strong>Penalties For A Prostitution Charge</strong></h2><p> </p><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3c2f06caac930af0f3f2_penalties-for-a-prostitution-charge-in-california.png\" alt=\"penalties-for-a-prostitution-charge-in-california\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>Under California’s Penal Code section <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=647.&amp;lawCode=PEN\" target=\"_blank\">647(b)</a>, prostitution is a misdemeanor offense. The penalty depends on the instances you had a prostitution arrest. The penalties for each offense are as follows:</p><ul><li>For first-time prostitution conviction: Up to six months custody in county jail and a $1,000 fine charges</li><li>For second-time prostitution conviction: A minimum of 45 days in county jail and a $1,000 fine charges</li><li>For third-time prostitution conviction: A minimum of 90 days in county jail and a $1,000 fine charges</li></ul><h2><strong>Legal Defenses Against Prostitution Charges In California</strong></h2><p>Once you are accused of prostitution, your future seems bleak. You may wonder how to fight the charge and eventually return to your everyday life. Most people are unaware of this, but several legal defenses are available, depending on your situation.</p><p>There is more than one way to fight a prostitution charge. Several common legal defenses include:</p><ul><li>There was no monetary exchange between you and the other party.</li><li>There was no agreement between you and the other participant to engage in sexual activity.</li><li>The cops utilized unlawful tactics to apprehend you.</li><li>Inadequate evidence exists to substantiate the legal components of the offense.</li><li>You have been the victim of mistaken identity or false accusations.</li></ul><h2><strong>New Protections For Sex Workers Under California Law</strong></h2><p>Senate Bill <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB233\" target=\"_blank\">233</a> under California Law protects sex workers from low-level criminal offenses. This bill protects everyone from being arrested when they report witnessing severe crimes to the police. Before the court passed the bill, sex workers often refused to report criminal activities out of fear that they might also be arrested in the process.</p><p>During the past few years, a police officer can form probable assumptions that someone is a sex worker if they carry a condom. Now, they cannot use the presence of condoms to assume that another person is loitering for prostitution.</p><h2><strong>The Experienced Criminal Defense Attorney At Summit Defense Will Protect Your Rights Against Sex Crimes Charges | Contact Us Now!</strong></h2><p> </p><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3c2f051ee2841705eb5e_california-criminal-defense-attorney.png\" alt=\"california-criminal-defense-attorney\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>It’s essential to act fast and speak with a sex crimes lawyer when you receive sex crime charges.

However, DUI charges have dramatically changed over the years. Presently, DUI cases carry serious consequences, the possibility of long jail sentences, a large number of fines, and the possibility of your driver’s license being revoked.</p><p>If you have been arrested for DUI, you have lots of questions going around your head. Is an attorney required? Can you represent yourself in the trial? If you choose a lawyer, won’t any lawyer be as good as another? We can answer that hiring an attorney should be the first thing you should consider once you have been arrested. However, not just any attorney but someone who can ensure that they are an expert DUI attorney, who has the experience and the knowledge required to alleviate the outcome of your case.</p><p>Here at Summit Defense Law Offices, we care about your rights. Our DUI defense attorney can help you give legal advice, fight your DUI charge.

We offer free consultation on your first visit.</p><h2>In What Way Can A DUI Lawyer Help?</h2><p>Experienced DUI attorneys specializing in handling these cases know that some mistakes are made throughout the arrest process. These mistakes, may it be intentional or not, may lead to people getting charged falsely or more severe charges being sought. So exposing these mistakes in the prosecution’s case is what helps beat DUI charges.</p><ul><li>Investigating Your Arrest</li></ul><p>A DUI lawyer will look thoroughly at your arrest reports and verify if the officer followed the law correctly. Improper vehicle pull-over or even not following the proper arrest procedure could lead to a dismissal of your case. An officer not telling you that it was a crime to decline a breathalyzer after your arrest can result in a dismissal of additional charges.</p><ul><li>Flaws in Chemical Tests</li></ul><p>The DUI lawyers will also look at the results of any blood or breath test taken at the time of your arrest. If the breathalyzer is faulty, not properly maintained, or proper lab procedures are not followed, your results may not be admitted as a piece of trial evidence. Conversely, your BAC or Blood Alcohol Content rises naturally over time. A breath test taken a couple more hours after the arrest may appear to have a higher BAC than you had when you were driving, placing you over the legal limit.</p><ul><li>Other Defenses</li></ul><p>An intoxicated person or any person under the influence found alone inside the car is usually assumed to have been driving the vehicle. The point is also considered even if they are sitting in the passenger seat. Subsequently, the prosecution must be able to prove that you were driving the vehicle while having or exceeding the BAC limit of 0.008%. Further, if the trial could not verify that you were not simply sleeping the effects of a few drinks before driving, your DUI charges can be dropped.</p><h2>What If I Represent My DUI Case By Myself?</h2><p>After a DUI arrest or DUI conviction either due to drugs or alcohol, you may risk facing severe consequences. To be exact, DUI cases may result in fines, jail time, loss of driver’s license, and worse, your job. You do not have to hire a good DUI lawyer to be your legal representation if you don’t want to, but at Summit Defense, we highly recommend that you do. There is so much at risk if your case is not successfully defended.</p><p>While you are entitled to represent yourself in a DUI trial, it is not the best idea out there. Based on experience, our DUI attorneys know how difficult trials can be, and it takes a lot of experience to succeed in the proceedings.</p><p>Hence, self-represented defendants’ lack of legal knowledge can put that person in great peril, especially at court. It is not uncommon for judges to have little patience for self-represented individuals unaware of the rules of the criminal court. You don’t have to face this alone; Summit Defense is here for you if you are going to trial.</p><p>Contact our experienced DUI attorney at Summit Defense if you are going to trial or have any further questions.</p><h2>Can I Just Hire A Public Defender To Handle My DUI Case?</h2><p>You have the right to an attorney if you cannot afford one. Public defenders are provided for defendants who meet specific financial requirements. You have to fall with a certain limit for income and savings before you become eligible for a public defender.</p><p>In parallel to that, Public defenders are licensed attorneys, if you ask. However, these DUI lawyers often have heavy caseloads and may not have all the necessary sources to provide excellent service to their clients.</p><p>So, even if you get a public defender, at the end of your case, either dismissed or convicted, the court may order you to pay the cost of the attorney services.</p><h2>What Should I Look For In A DUI Attorney?</h2><p>When looking for a lawyer, you should look for someone who has tons of experience. On top of that, you should take a lot of time to research the following: How many cases does the DUI lawyer handle? How many did plead guilty or acquittals have been able to attain? What type of outcomes has the majority of their cases received? How much experience and education in the DUI field does the attorney have? All of these questions must be answered to make the proper choice in legal representation.</p><p>The right choice can help you keep your freedom and especially your driver’s license. Plus, the right attorney can help you get your case dropped due to incorrect procedures by the arresting officer or the police system. Do not leave your DUI criminal defense up to chance; secure that you have the legal representation that you need and the required legal counsel to understand the consequences that you face.</p><h2>How Much Does A DUI Lawyer Cost?</h2><p>The cost of a good DUI attorney depends on the severity of the case and the charge. When entering a plea deal, a DUI lawyer will usually cost approximately anywhere between $700 and $1,500. However, if your case ends up going to trial, the cost of the lawyer will increase. So on average, the price of a lawyer taking a case to trial varies between $1,500 and $4,000+.</p><h2>Is There Any Chance Of Getting Convicted Even If I Hire A DUI Lawyer?</h2><p>Depending on your state, a DUI conviction can stay on your driving record for 75 years. Some states also do not allow DUI charges to be expunged. Given how hard it is to beat a DUI charge, it is probably safe to say that the overwhelming majority of individuals who beat their driving under the influence charges had the right lawyer helping them.</p><h2>A Summit Defense DUI Lawyer Will Fight For Your Rights</h2><p>If you are ready to find the right DUI lawyer for your case, call us at <a href=\"tel:%2018665604276\" target=\"_blank\">1 (866) 560-4276</a> or fill out our <a href=\"https://www.summitdefense.com/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">online form</a>.

The hassle and everything in between can shred significant amounts of time outside preparing for what will happen to your money, bills, possessions, and other concerns. However, even though you are inside the prison, your financial obligations won’t go away. On top of that, you still have bills that need to be paid. Imagine you’re inside the cell thinking about your bills.</p><p>In addition, you will no longer have access to your personal or joint bank account, making various financial obligations much more difficult. The government believes that they can seize assets too. Your best-case scenario is when you post bail and make arrangements for your finances before being convicted. If you were not able to post bail, someone has to do the duties.</p><h2>What About My Outstanding Bills?</h2><p>This is one of the essential things you need to put a lot of thought into before you are convicted. Even though you have a family member or a close friend to take care of your personal belongings, everyone has their bills to be paid while they are behind bars.</p><p>A prime example of that is monthly streaming subscriptions and pending credit card payments. Moreover, suppose your property is not in the care of any of your family members. In that case, you might lose that entirely if your account balance is depleted and low for the automatic withdrawals associated with paying rent, storage units, or mortgage.</p><p>If you have no recurring payments, any money you have in your bank accounts when you are in a prison sentence is still yours. However, they are problems that might arise since many banks will freeze your account if no activity occurs with six to twelve months. If your sentence is longer than this period, a minor recurring payment may be beneficial to prevent your account from becoming frozen.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, the government may also freeze your accounts for extended periods and eventually seize the funds if they prove you financially benefitted from the crime.</p><h2>Who Will Take Care Of My Businesses While I’m In Jail?</h2><p>This is the reason why many lawyers recommend taking care of your property and financial situation before you end up incarcerated. This matter is extremely difficult to do if you are arrested and unable to post bail. But you may still be able to handle some of these matters by meeting your defense attorney before being convicted.</p><p>If you are sentenced to jail, a defense lawyer can ask the judge for a report date for custody. In turn, you can have a set amount of time to take care of all of this.</p><p>Also, while you are in prison, you need someone to handle your business. For most people, this means giving your business partner or a close friend your business assets.</p><h2>How Do I Manage My Finances While In Prison?</h2><p>Once you are in prison, you will no longer be able to manage your finances. Your options are to make arrangements for someone else to handle your financial obligations on your behalf. Some of these options include:</p><ul><li><strong>Giving Legal Authority to a Family Member or a Friend</strong>. Instead of transferring your money to another person, you could provide them with the authority to do such duties. This is safer since their control can be limited.</li><li><strong>Temporarily Assign Assets to a Loved one</strong>. You can also transfer, not only money, your assets to a loved one or close friend. But, once you transfer your assets to these persons, they are not obligated to return those. So you better have to choose someone that you could trust your money and investments.</li><li><strong>Put Your Assets Into a Trust and Give Power of Attorney to a Financial Professional</strong>. Putting all your assets in a trust is leaving the obligations to these trustees. The option is certainly worth considering, especially if you have a massive amount of assets.</li></ul><p>It is also crucial to finding someone you can trust to regularly access your funds or pay your bills while you are in prison. Depending on your financial status, you can always choose the most reasonable option.</p><h2>What Will Happen To My House?</h2><p>Any kind of prison sentence does not exempt you from paying your lease or mortgage. Depending on whether you rent, you have your own or other property; you have two options:</p><ul><li><strong>Renting</strong>. If you are renting, it is human instinct to cut or end the lease immediately while in prison. You may not want to do this if you will be in jail for a month. But, if you will be incarcerated for a longer term, it would be best to pay the penalty to end your contract early, so you don’t have to continue paying rent.</li><li><strong>Homeowner</strong>. This is a much-complicated situation since the question lies if you can afford to continue paying the mortgage while in prison because you don’t have income. A prison sentence means that you no longer have inward funds, but a house payment will mean that you still have to pay that. So, if you are not in an ideal financial position right now, you may think about leasing your place to someone else or contact your mortgage company to see if they could lower the payments while you are in prison.</li></ul><h2>What Will Happen To My Money In The Bank?</h2><p>This situation solely depends on the charges on which you’ve been convicted. For most crimes, your money remains in your bank account. However, for other crimes, your bank account may be frozen. Even you stay in control of your money, some banks may freeze your account as a safety feature.</p><ul><li><strong>Frozen By the Government</strong>. If you have been convicted or charged with a crime where the government believes you financially benefitted, they may freeze your entire assets. This happens mostly if you’ve been convicted of selling drugs or insider trading. In some circumstance, the government also seize the funds.</li><li><strong>Frozen By the Bank</strong>. Many banks freeze bank accounts that haven’t been used in a couple of months. This is a safety feature, but this also means that you don’t have access to your money until you contact the bank and tell the situation.</li></ul><h2>Can I Still Access My Funds While In Prison?</h2><p>Unfortunately, you don’t have any access to your regular bank accounts while serving time. However, there is an option. That option is that you may have access to a prison account or prison trust set up by the state in order to make purchases from approved catalogs. You can designate someone whom you trust the most to do this. Rules for these accounts vary by state or prison, so you need to check with your prison to learn specific rules.</p><h2>Things You Should Do Prior To Your Imprisonment</h2><p>Suppose you have plans to open a bank account, do it before you are incarcerated because you will not be able to open a bank account while you are in prison, as all banks require a physical appearance for that. In addition, even you are sentenced to life imprisonment, you should still care for your finances in case something happens. You might be paroled or released; we don’t know. If you think prison is where you will live for the rest of your life, you may also want to create a will just in case something terrible happens.</p><h2>Get Help From A Top California Criminal Defense Law Firm | Summit Defense</h2><p>If you have questions about what happens to your stuff or belongings if you end up being incarcerated, don’t hesitate to contact our experienced defense attorney to know more information about how to manage your possessions and other stuff before going to prison or while in prison.

Are there time limits on when a person can be charged with the crime of Driving Under the Influence?</p><p>Time moves fast when you are having fun. One after another, you take shots trying to catch up with the euphoria in the room. Then you need to drive home, and the next thing you see is the flashing red and blue lights. That’s when you realize you hit someone.</p><p>Driving under the influence is punishable by law. Drunk driving is a negligent act that could cost the lives of other people.</p><p>Police officers can issue a DUI arrest if they verify that you are not in the proper condition to drive. An officer is unlikely to let you go if they deem you as a roadway threat.</p><h3>What Should I Do If I Meet A DUI Car Accident?</h3><p>If you get caught in a car accident, the responding officer will have reasonable suspicion that you are intoxicated. They will most likely run necessary tests to prove this suspicion.</p><p>When you get caught in a DUI accident, keep these tips in mind:</p><ul><li>Don’t let your emotion get the best of you. Keep yourself calm and collected as much as possible.</li><li>Never accept liability or responsibility for what happened.</li><li>Don’t give too much information during an interrogation. Since it is impossible to remain silent, only provide direct answers and don’t expand the details.</li><li>Ask the responding officer if you are free to go. Otherwise, request for an attorney.</li></ul><p>Don’t give the authority the proof they need to prosecute you with DUI charges. Remain calm and don’t accept any liabilities. Ask for your right to speak with your attorney to protect your rights.</p><p>Seek the help of an experienced DUI defense lawyer when involved in a suspected DUI accident. An accomplished DUI lawyer has years of experience winning DUI charges.</p><h3>Am I Going To Be Arrested At The Accident’s Scene?</h3><p>If the officer at the scene has enough evidence to incriminate you with DUI charges, they can and will arrest you right on the spot.</p><p>Police officers have the duty to uphold the safety of every road driver. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is a threat to that roadway safety. This is why they have the responsibility of arresting intoxicated driving violators.</p><p>Additionally, breathalyzers and blood tests can only measure drugs and alcohol analytes for a specific amount of time. They cannot test your alcohol levels for the previous day.</p><p>You can reject these tests if you don’t feel comfortable. You can request for a <a href=\"https://www.summitdefense.com/attorneys/\" target=\"_blank\">lawyer</a> to represent on your behalf. This can give you the sense of security that the authority will not violate your rights in this event.</p><h3>What Is The Statute Of Limitations For DUI Cases In California?</h3><p>You may ask, “How long after an accident can I be charged with a DUI?”.</p><p>If on a rare occasion, a police officer lets you go and decides not to arrest you at the accident scene, the victim can file a criminal charge within three years for felony criminal charges and one year for misdemeanor charges.</p><p>The state of California set this <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=802.\" target=\"_blank\">statute of limitations</a> for DUI charges. These limitations indicate the specific amount of time the victim can file criminal charges against the defendant.</p><p>If the other party did not file a DUI charge against you within this limited time, then the state cannot file charges against you.</p><p>This extended time provided by the law will allow the injured party to gather enough evidence to incriminate you with intoxicated driving charges.</p><p>You need to act swiftly and hire an experienced attorney to represent you on your behalf. They can help you establish your facts to avoid these charges. Make sure to select an attorney with relevant experience in DUI charges.</p><h3>What Are The Criminal Charges For A DUI Offender? How About Civil Penalties?</h3><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3ccf560bbc5caa778aa2_can-a-lawyer-really-help-with-dui.png\" alt=\"criminal-charges-for-dui-offender\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>The <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=23153.&amp;lawCode=VEH#:~:text=(a)%20It%20is%20unlawful%20for,person%20other%20than%20the%20driver.\" target=\"_blank\">California Law</a> punishes violators of roadway safety. The severity of the punishment varies on the nature of the accident. The court can give felony charges or misdemeanor charges.</p><p>If the court agrees on a felony charge for DUIs involving accidents, the defendant will face up to three years in county jail. They are also fined with a fine of up to $5,000. The at-fault driver’s driving privilege may also be suspended for up to three years.</p><p>Otherwise, if the court decides that the charge is a misdemeanor, the defendant will face one year of jail time in county jail. The fine for a misdemeanor charge is up to $1,000. The defendant may also lose their driving privilege for one year.</p><p>Depending on the circumstances, the court can also sentence the defendant to a probation period. This means that they are prohibited from driving with any amount of alcohol in their body. Furthermore, the defendant may not commit any criminal offense during this time.</p><p>Generally speaking, DUI accidents have both criminal penalties and civil penalties. These penalties will depend on the severity of the accident caused.</p><ul><li>1st offense of misdemeanor DUI: Up to six months jail time in county jail.

A driving record is a factor insurance companies consider in determining your car insurance rates. If you are involved in a DUI accident, your insurance can <a href=\"https://www.insure.com/car-insurance/insurance-company-pays-for-illegal-acts.html\" target=\"_blank\">shoot up to 79%</a>.</p><h3>How Does A DUI Case Affect Your Life?</h3><ul><li>Your DUI case might affect your chance of finding a job. Most employers do background checks before they hire an applicant. If they find out your criminal charges, they might think twice before welcoming you into their company.</li><li>A Drunk driving case can also impact your personal relationships. Your friends or family members may be more attentive and pry on your personal life.</li><li>Most schools reject scholarship requests from a student with a DUI record. Most colleges at this time conduct thorough background checks on their students.</li><li>Depending on the severity, your driver’s license may be revoked or temporarily suspended after the DUI accident.

Individuals whose primary job is to drive may also risk their employment.</li></ul><h3>Contact A DUI Lawyer As Soon As Possible</h3><figure><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6196d6f46e036ad1961bf795/61df3df24e1ac45d677b5708_contact-a-dui-lawyer.png\" alt=\"contact-a-dui-lawyer\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><p>DUI cases are complicated cases to handle.
