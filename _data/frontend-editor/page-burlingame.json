From our initial meeting, she was very passionate about my situation and showed the utmost concern for my fear as this was the first time I found myself in a helpless position. I felt a range of emotions starting from nervousness to guilt, but Tennille had always communicated with me in such a personal level to where I was assured that I was in good hands. Throughout the entirety of my case, Tennille and her paralegal always kept an open line of communication with me and was extremely patient; I would receive updates from the firm as they came &amp; felt very much in the loop at all times. Ultimately, Tennille got me an offer I didn’t even think would across the table! I am so very grateful for Tennille &amp; the entire Summit team for the tireless effort they put towards my case.","tn20daf416":"Pacifica, CA","tn250a5e2d":"Tennille was such a pleasure to work with! She was the most thorough, attentive, and professional attorney I have ever dealt with. She was always a call or text away from answering my questions and concerns. Tennille was able to get my DUI arrest dismissed on the grounds that I was factually innocent. I feel like a huge burden was lifted off my shoulders, and now I can go back to a squeaky clean record. I am in sincere gratitude for all of Tennille &amp; Summit’s efforts!
